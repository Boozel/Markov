Once upon a time

in a kingdom far, far away,



 

                   

the king and queen were blessed

with a beautiful baby girl.



 

                   

And throughout the land,

everyone was happy...



 

                   

until the sun went down



 

                   

and they saw that their daughter was

cursed with a frightful enchantment



 

                   

that took hold each and every night.



 

                   

Desperate, they sought the help

of a fairy godmother



 

                   

who had them lock the young princess

away in a tower,



 

                   

there to await the kiss...

of the handsome Prince Charming.



  

                   

[horse whinnies]



  

                   

It was he who would chance

the perilous journey



  

                   

through blistering cold

and scorching desert



  

                   

traveling for many days and nights,



  

                   

risking life and limb



  

                   

to reach the Dragon's keep.

For he was the bravest,



  

                   

and most handsome...



  

                   

in all the land.



  

                   

And it was destiny that his kiss



  

                   

would break the dreaded curse.



  

                   

He alone would climb to the highest room

of the tallest tower



  

                   

to enter the princess's chambers,

cross the room to her sleeping silhouette,



  

                   

pull back the gossamer curtains

to find her... [gasps]



  

                   

What?



  

                   

- Princess... Fiona?

- No!



  

                   

[sighs relief] Oh, thank heavens.

Where is she?



  

                   

- She's on her honeymoon.

- Honeymoon? With whom?



  

                   

- She's on her honeymoon.

- Honeymoon? With whom?

- [softly] I think that's our little girl.



   

                   

That's not little!

That's a really big problem.



   

                   

Wasn't she supposed to kiss

Prince Charming and break the spell?



   

                   

Well, he's no Prince Charming,

but they do look...



   

                   

[softly] Happy now?

We came. We saw them.



   

                   

Now let's go before

they light the torches.



   

                   

- They're my parents.

- Hello? They locked you in a tower.



   

                   

That was for my own...



   

                   

Good! Here's our chance. Let's go

back inside and pretend we're not home.



   

                   

Harold, we have to be...



   

                   

Quick! While they're not looking

we can make a run for it.



   

                   

Shrek, stop it!

Everything's gonna be...



   

                   

A disaster! There is no way...



   

                   

- You can do this.

- I really...



   

                   

- Really...

- don't... want... to... be...



   

                   

Here!



   

                   

Mom... Dad...



   

                   

I'd like you to meet my husband...



   

                   

Shrek.



   

                   

Well, um...



   

                   

It's easy to see where Fiona

gets her good looks from.



   

                   

[chuckles nervously]



   

                   

[gulps]



   

                   

[belches]



   

                   

- Excuse me.

- [Shrek & Fiona laugh]



   

                   

Better out than in,

I always say, eh, Fiona?



   

                   

[both giggle]



   

                   

[Shrek] That's good.



   

                   

I guess not.



   

                   

What do you mean, "not on the list"?

Don't tell me you don't know who I am.



   

                   

What do you mean, "not on the list"?

Don't tell me you don't know who I am.



   

                   

What's happening, everybody?

Thanks for waiting.



   

                   

- I had the hardest time finding this place.

- No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!



   

                   

No, Dad! It's all right.

It's all right. He's with us.



   

                   

- He helped rescue me from the dragon.

- That's me: the noble steed.



   

                   

Waiter!

How 'bout a bowl for the steed?



   

                   

Oh, boy.



   

                   

[slurps]



   

                   

- Um, Shrek?

- Yeah?



   

                   

Oh, sorry!

Great soup, Mrs Q.



   

                   

Mmm!



   

                   

No, no. Darling.



   

                   

[chuckles nervously] Oh!



   

                   

So, Fiona, tell us

about where you live.



   

                   

Well...



   

                   

Shrek owns his own land.



   

                   

- Don't you, honey?

- Oh, yes!



   

                   

It's in an enchanted forest



   

                   

abundant in squirrels

and cute little duckies and...



   

                   

[laughing] What?



   

                   

I know you ain't

talking about the swamp.



   

                   

An ogre from a swamp.

Oh! How original.



   

                   

I suppose that would be a fine place

to raise the children.



   

                   

- [splutters]

- [chokes]



   

                   

It's a bit early to be

thinking about that, isn't it?



   

                   

- Indeed. I just started eating.

- Harold!



   

                   

- What's that supposed to mean?

- Dad. It's great, OK?



   

                   

- For his type, yes.

- My type?



   

                   

I got to go to the bathroom.



   

                   

- Dinner is served!

- Never mind. I can hold it.



   

                   

Bon appetit!



   

                   

Oh, Mexican food!

My favorite.



   

                   

Let's not sit here with our tummies

rumbling. Everybody dig in.



   

                   

Don't mind if I do, Lillian.



   

                   

I suppose any grandchildren

I could expect from you would be...



   

                   

Ogres, yes!



   

                   

Not that there's anything wrong with that.

Right, Harold?



   

                   

Oh, no! No! Of course, not!



   

                   

That is, assuming you don't

eat your own young!



   

                   

Dad!



   

                   

No, we usually prefer the ones

who've been locked away in a tower!



   

                   

- Shrek, please!

- I only did that because I love her.



   

                   

Aye, day care

or dragon-guarded castle.



   

                   

You wouldn't understand.

You're not her father!



   

                   

It's so nice to have the family

together for dinner.



   

                   

- Harold!

- Shrek!



   

                   

- Fiona!

- Fiona!



   

                   

- Mom!

- Harold...



   

                   

Donkey!



   

                   

[glissando]



   

                   

  Your fallen tears have called to me



   

                   

  So, here comes my sweet remedy



   

                   

  I know what every princess needs



   

                   

  For her to live life happily...  



   

                   

[both gasp]



   

                   

Oh, my dear.

Oh, look at you.



   

                   

You're all grown up.



   

                   

- Who are you?

- Oh, sweet pea!



   

                   

I'm your fairy godmother.



   

                   

- I have a fairy godmother?

- Shush, shush.



   

                   

Now, don't worry.

I'm here to make it all better.



   

                   

With just a...



   

                   

  Wave of my magic wand

Your troubles will soon be gone



   

                   

  With a flick of the wrist and just a flash

You'll land a prince with a ton of cash



   

                   

  A high-priced dress

made by mice no less



   

                   

  Some crystal glass pumps

And no more stress



   

                   

  Your worries will vanish,

your soul will cleanse



   

                   

  Confide in your very own

furniture friends



   

                   

  We'll help you set a new fashion trend



   

                   

-   I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great

-   The kind of girl a prince would date!



   

                   

  They'll write your name

on the bathroom wall...



   

                   

  "For a happy ever after,

give Fiona a call!"



   

                   

  A sporty carriage to ride in style,

Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle



   

                   

  Banish your blemishes, tooth decay,

Cellulite thighs will fade away



   

                   

  And oh, what the hey!

Have a bichon frisé! '



   

                   

  Nip and tuck, here and there

to land that prince with the perfect hair



   

                   

  Lipstick liners, shadows blush

To get that prince with the sexy tush



   

                   

  Lucky day, hunk buffet

You and your prince take a roll in the hay



   

                   

  You can spoon on the moon

With the prince to the tune



   

                   

  Don't be drab, you'll be fab

Your prince will have rock-hard abs



   

                   

  Cheese soufflé, Valentine's Day

Have some chicken fricassee!



   

                   

  Nip and tuck, here and there

To land that prince with the perfect hair  



   

                   

Stop!



   

                   

[chuckles] Look...



   

                   

Thank you very much,

Fairy Godmother,



   

                   

but I really don't need all this.



   

                   

[gasps and mutterings of disapproval]



   

                   

- Fine. Be that way.

- We didn't like you, anyway.



   

                   

- [knocking]

- [Shrek] Fiona? Fiona?



   

                   

[dog barks]



   

                   

Oh! You got a puppy?

All I got in my room was shampoo.



   

                   

Oh, uh...



   

                   

Fairy Godmother, furniture...



   

                   

[giggles]



   

                   

I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.



   

                   

Your husband? What? What did you say?

When did this happen?



   

                   

Shrek is the one who rescued me.



   

                   

- But that can't be right.

- Oh, great, more relatives!



   

                   

She's just trying to help.



   

                   

Good! She can help us pack.

Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.



   

                   

- What?

- I don't want to leave.



   

                   

When did you decide this?



   

                   

- Shortly after arriving.

- Look, I'm sorry...



   

                   

No, that's all right.

I need to go, anyway.



   

                   

But remember, dear.

If you should ever need me...



   

                   

happiness...



   

                   

is just a teardrop away.



   

                   

Thanks, but we've got all

the happiness we need.



   

                   

Happy, happy, happy...



   

                   

[laughs] So I see.



   

                   

Let's go, Kyle.



   

                   

- Very nice, Shrek.

- What?



   

                   

I told you coming here was a bad idea.



   

                   

You could've at least tried

to get along with my father.



   

                   

I don't think I was going to get

Daddy's blessing,



   

                   

even if I did want it.



   

                   

Do you think it might be nice

if somebody asked me what I wanted?



   

                   

Sure. Do you want me

to pack for you?



   

                   

You're unbelievable!

You're behaving like a...



   

                   

- Go on! Say it!

- Like an ogre!



   

                   

Here's a news flash for you!



   

                   

Whether your parents like it or not...

I am an ogre!



   

                   

- [yelps]

- [roars]



   

                   

And guess what, Princess?

That's not about to change.



   

                   

I've made changes for you, Shrek.

Think about that.



   

                   

That's real smooth, Shrek.

"I'm an ogre!"



   

                   

[mimics Shrek roaring]



   

                   

[sniffling]



   

                   

I knew this would happen.



   

                   

[Lillian] You should.

You started it.



   

                   

I can hardly believe that, Lillian.

He's the ogre. Not me.



   

                   

I think, Harold, you're taking this

a little too personally.



   

                   

This is Fiona's choice.



   

                   

But she was supposed to choose

the prince we picked for her.



   

                   

I mean, you expect me to give

my blessings to this... thing?



   

                   

Fiona does.

And she'll never forgive you if you don't.



   

                   

I don't want to lose

our daughter again, Harold.



   

                   

Oh, you act as if love

is totally predictable.



   

                   

Don't you remember when

we were young?



   

                   

We used to walk

down by the lily pond and...



   

                   

- they were in bloom...

- Our first kiss.



   

                   

It's not the same!



   

                   

I don't think you realize that

our daughter has married a monster!



   

                   

Oh, stop being such a drama king.



   

                   

Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!



   

                   

La, di, da, di, da!

Isn't it all wonderful!



   

                   

I'd like to know

how it could get any worse!



   

                   

- Hello, Harold.

- [gasps]



   

                   

- What happened?

- Nothing, dear!



   

                   

Just the old crusade wound

playing up a bit!



   

                   

[chuckles]



   

                   

I'll just stretch it

out here for a while.



   

                   

You better get in.

We need to talk.



   

                   

Actually, Fairy Godmother,

off to bed.



   

                   

[yawns] Already taken my pills,

and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.



   

                   

So, how about... we make this

a quick visit. What?



   

                   

Oh, hello.

Ha-ha-ha!



   

                   

So, what's new?



   

                   

You remember my son,

Prince Charming?



   

                   

Is that you? My gosh!

It's been years.



   

                   

When did you get back?



   

                   

Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.



   

                   

After I endured blistering winds,

scorching desert...



   

                   

I climbed to the highest room

in the tallest tower...



   

                   

Mommy can handle this.



   

                   

He endures blistering winds

and scorching desert!



   

                   

He climbs to the highest bloody room

of the tallest bloody tower...



   

                   

And what does he find?



   

                   

Some gender-confused wolf

telling him that his princess



   

                   

is already married.



   

                   

It wasn't my fault.

He didn't get there in time.



   

                   

Stop the car!



   

                   

[crash]



   

                   

Harold.



   

                   

You force me to do something

I really don't want to do.



   

                   

[gasps] Where are we?



   

                   

Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!

May I take your order?



   

                   

My diet is ruined!

I hope you're happy. Er... okay.



   

                   

Two Renaissance Wraps,

no mayo... chili rings...



   

                   

- I'll have the Medieval Meal.

- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...



   

                   

- Curly fries?

- No, thank you.



   

                   

- Sourdough soft taco, then?

- No, really, I'm fine.



   

                   

Your order, Fairy Godmother.

This comes with the Medieval Meal.



   

                   

There you are, dear.



   

                   

We made a deal, Harold, and I assume

you don't want me to go back on my part.



   

                   

[sighs deeply] Indeed not.



   

                   

So, Fiona and Charming will be together.



   

                   

- Yes.

- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.



   

                   

Not only for your daughter...



   

                   

but for your Kingdom.



   

                   

What am I supposed to do about it?



   

                   

Use your imagination.



   

                   

[whooshing]



   

                   

[whinnies]



   

                   

Oh...



   

                   

Come on in, Your Majesty.



   

                   

[piano plays, people talk]



   

                   

  I like my town

[barman belches]



   

                   

[clears throat] Excuse me.



   

                   

Do I know you?



   

                   

No, you must be mistaking me

for someone else.



   

                   

Uh... excuse me.

I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister.



   

                   

Ah! There you are. Right.



   

                   

You see, I need to have

someone taken care of.



   

                   

- Who's the guy?

- Well, he's not a guy, per se.



   

                   

Um... He's an ogre.



   

                   

[crowd gasp]



   

                   

Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.



   

                   

There's only one fellow who can handle

a job like that, and, frankly...



   

                   

he don't like to be disturbed.



   

                   

he don't like to be disturbed.



   

                   

Where could I find him?



   

                   

[knock on door]



   

                   

Hello?



   

                   

Who dares enter my room?



   

                   

Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but

I'm told you're the one to talk to



   

                   

about an ogre problem?



   

                   

You are told correct.



   

                   

But for this, I charge

a great deal of money.



   

                   

Would... this be enough?



   

                   

You have engaged my valuable

services, Your Majesty.



   

                   

Just tell me where

I can find this ogre.

  Everyone says

I'm getting down too low



   

                   

  Everyone says

you've just gotta let it go



   

                   

  You just gotta let it go



   

                   

  I need some sleep



   

                   

  Time to put the old horse down



   

                   

  I'm in too deep



   

                   

  And the wheels keep spinning round



   

                   

  Everyone says

you've just gotta let it go

Dear Knight, I pray that you take

this favor as a token of my gratitude.

Dear Diary...



   

                   

Sleeping Beauty is having

a slumber party tomorrow,



   

                   

but Dad says I can't go.

He never lets me out after sunset.



   

                   

Dad says I'm going away for a while.



   

                   

Must be like some finishing school.



   

                   

Mom says that when I'm old enough,



   

                   

my Prince Charming will rescue me

from my tower



   

                   

and bring me back to my family,



   

                   

and we'll all live

happily ever after.



   

                   

Mrs. Fiona Charming.

[knock on door]



   

                   

Sorry. I hope I'm not

interrupting anything.



   

                   

No, no. I was just reading a, uh...

a scary book.



   

                   

I was hoping you'd let me apologize

for my despicable behavior earlier.



   

                   

- Okay...

- I don't know what came over me.



   

                   

Do you suppose we could pretend

it never happened and start over...



   

                   

- Look, Your Majesty, I just...

- Please. Call me Dad.



   

                   

Dad. We both acted like ogres.



   

                   

Maybe we just need some time

to get to know each other.



   

                   

Excellent idea! I was actually hoping

you might join me for a morning hunt.



   

                   

A little father-son time?



   

                   

I know it would mean

the world to Fiona.



   

                   

[sighs]

[birds twitter]



   

                   

[Shrek] Face it, Donkey!

We're lost.



   

                   

We can't be lost. We followed

the King's instructions exactly.



   

                   

"Head to the

darkest part of the woods..."



   

                   

"Past the sinister trees

with scary-looking branches."



   

                   

- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!

- We passed that three times already!



   

                   

You were the one who said

not to stop for directions.



   

                   

Oh, great. My one chance

to fix things up with Fiona's dad



   

                   

and I end up lost

in the woods with you!



   

                   

Don't get huffy!

I'm only trying to help.



   

                   

I know! I know.



   

                   

- I'm sorry, all right?

- Hey, don't worry about it.



   

                   

I just really need to make

things work with this guy.



   

                   

Yeah, sure. Now let's go

bond with Daddy.



   

                   

[purring]



   

                   

[purring]



   

                   

Well, well, well, Donkey.



   

                   

I know it was kind of a tender

moment back there, but the purring?



   

                   

What? I ain't purring.



   

                   

Sure. What's next? A hug?



   

                   

Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.

What do you think I am, some kind of a...



   

                   

Ha-ha!

Fear me, if you dare!



   

                   

[hisses]



   

                   

Look! A little cat.



   

                   

- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!

- It's a cat, Donkey.



   

                   

Come here,

little kitty, kitty.



   

                   

Come on, little kitty. Come here.

Oh! Come here, little kitty.



   

                   

- [screaming]

- Whoa!



   

                   

- Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!

- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!



   

                   

Oh, God. Oh...



   

                   

No!



   

                   

- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!

- Get it off!



   

                   

Shrek! Hold still!



   

                   

- Did I miss?

- No. You got them.



   

                   

Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...



   

                   

Puss... in Boots!



   

                   

I'll kill that cat!

- [chuckles] Hairball.

- Oh! That is nasty!



   

                   

What should we do with him?



   

                   

Take the sword and neuter him.

Give him the Bob Barker treatment.



   

                   

Oh, no! Por favor!

Please!



   

                   

I implore you!

It was nothing personal, Señor.



   

                   

I was doing it only for my family.



   

                   

My mother, she is sick.

And my father lives off the garbage!



   

                   

The King offered me much in gold

and I have a litter of brothers...



   

                   

Whoa, whoa, whoa!



   

                   

Fiona's father paid you to do this?



   

                   

The rich King? Sí.



   

                   

[screams]



   

                   

Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing.



   

                   

Don't feel bad. Almost everybody

that meets you wants to kill you.



   

                   

Gee, thanks.



   

                   

Maybe Fiona would've been better off

if I were some sort of Prince Charming.



   

                   

That's what the King said.



   

                   

Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question

was directed at me.



   

                   

Shrek, Fiona knows

you'd do anything for her.



   

                   

Well, it's not like

I wouldn't change if I could.



   

                   

I just... I just wish

I could make her happy.



   

                   

Hold the phone...



   

                   

"Happiness."



   

                   

"A tear drop away."



   

                   

Donkey! Think of the saddest thing

that's ever happened to you!



   

                   

Aw, man, where do I begin?



   

                   

First there was the time that old farmer

tried to sell me for some magic beans.



   

                   

Then this fool had a party and he have

the guests trying to pin the tail on me.



   

                   

Then they got drunk and start beating me

with a stick, going "Piñata!!"



   

                   

What is a piñata, anyway?



   

                   

No, Donkey! I need you to cry!



   

                   

Don't go projecting on me.



   

                   

I know you're feeling bad,

but you got to...



   

                   

Aaaahhh!



   

                   

You little, hairy,

litter-licking sack of...



   

                   

What? Is it on? Is it on?



   

                   

[clears throat]



   

                   

This is Fairy Godmother.



   

                   

I'm either away

from my desk or with a client.



   

                   

But if you come by the office, we'll be

glad to make you an appointment.



   

                   

Have a "happy ever after."



   

                   

Oh...



   

                   

Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?



   

                   

That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey,

on another whirlwind adventure!



   

                   

  Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo!

We're on the move!



   

                   

- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.

- Join the club. We've got jackets.



   

                   

On my honor, I am obliged to accompany

you until I have saved your life



   

                   

as you have spared me mine.



   

                   

The position of annoying talking animal

has already been taken.



   

                   

Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?



   

                   

- Shrek!

- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him...



   

                   

in his wee little boots.



   

                   

You know, how many cats can wear boots?

Honestly.



   

                   

- Let's keep him!

- Say what?



   

                   

[purrs]



   

                   

Ahh!



   

                   

Listen. He's purring!



   

                   

- Oh, so now it's cute.

- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.



   

                   

Lighten up? I should lighten up?

Look who's telling who to lighten up!



   

                   

Lighten up? I should lighten up?

Look who's telling who to lighten up!



   

                   

[giggles] Shrek!



   

                   

[barks]



   

                   

[barks]



   

                   

Shrek?



   

                   

They're both festive, aren't they?



   

                   

What do you think, Harold?



   

                   

Um... Yes, yes.

Fine. Fine.



   

                   

[sighs]



   

                   

Try to at least pretend you're interested

in your daughter's wedding ball.



   

                   

Honestly, Lillian,

I don't think it matters.



   

                   

How do we know there will

even be a ball?



   

                   

Mom. Dad.



   

                   

- Oh, hello, dear.

- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.



   

                   

Mom, have you seen Shrek?



   

                   

I haven't.

You should ask your father.



   

                   

Be sure and use small words, dear.

He's a little slow this morning.



   

                   

- Can I help you, Your Majesty?

- Ah, yes! Um...



   

                   

Mmm! Exquisite.

What do you call this dish?



   

                   

That would be the dog's breakfast,

Your Majesty.



   

                   

Ah, yes. Very good, then.

Carry on, Cedric.



   

                   

- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?

- No, I haven't, dear.



   

                   

I'm sure he just went off to look for

a nice... mud hole to cool down in.



   

                   

You know, after your

little spat last night.



   

                   

Oh. You heard that, huh?



   

                   

The whole kingdom heard you.



   

                   

I mean, after all,

it is in his nature to be...



   

                   

well, a bit of a brute.



   

                   

Him? You know, you didn't exactly

roll out the Welcome Wagon.



   

                   

Well, what did you expect?

Look at what he's done to you.



   

                   

Shrek loves me for who I am.



   

                   

I would think you'd be happy for me.



   

                   

Darling, I'm just thinking about

what's best for you.



   

                   

Maybe you should do the same.



   

                   

[both whisper]



   

                   

No, really?



   

                   

[both laugh]



   

                   

[Shrek] Shh...



   

                   

Oh...



   

                   

[hooter blasts]



   

                   

Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.

Let's back away slowly.



   

                   

That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.



   

                   

She's the largest producer of hexes

and potions in the whole kingdom.



   

                   

Then why don't we pop in there

for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!



   

                   

[Puss in Boots

shrieks with laughter]



   

                   

[Puss in Boots] He makes me laugh.



   

                   

Hi. I'm here to see the...



   

                   

The Fairy Godmother.

I'm sorry. She is not in.



   

                   

Jerome!

Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!



   

                   

[sighs]



   

                   

Yes, Fairy Godmother.

Right away.



   

                   

Look, she's not seeing

any clients today, OK?



   

                   

That's OK, buddy.

We're from the union.



   

                   

The union?



   

                   

We represent the workers in all magical

industries, both evil and benign.



   

                   

Oh! Oh, right.



   

                   

Are you feeling at all

degraded or oppressed?



   

                   

Uh... a little.

We don't even have dental.



   

                   

They don't even have dental.



   

                   

Okay, we'll just have

a look around.



   

                   

Oh. By the way.



   

                   

I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother

didn't know we were here.



   

                   

- Know what I'm saying? Huh?

- Huh? Huh? Huh?



   

                   

- Stop it.

- Of course. Go right in.



   

                   

[voices and grinding machines]



   

                   

[explosion]



   

                   

A drop of desire.



   

                   

[giggles] Naughty!



   

                   

A pinch of passion.



   

                   

[laughs]



   

                   

And just a hint of...



   

                   

lust!



   

                   

[laughs]



   

                   

- [Shrek] Excuse me.

- [gasps]



   

                   

Sorry to barge in like this...



   

                   

What in Grimm's name

are you doing here?



   

                   

Well, it seems

that Fiona's not exactly happy.



   

                   

Oh-ho-ho!



   

                   

And there's some question

as to why that is?



   

                   

Well, let's explore that, shall we?



   

                   

Ah. P, P, P...

Princess. Cinderella.



   

                   

Here we are.

"Lived happily ever after." Oh...



   

                   

[laughs] No ogres!



   

                   

Let's see. Snow White.



   

                   

A handsome prince.

Oh, no ogres.



   

                   

Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!



   

                   

Hansel and Gretel? No!

Thumbelina? No.



   

                   

The Golden Bird,

the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...



   

                   

No, no, no, no, no!



   

                   

You see, ogres don't

live happily ever after.



   

                   

All right, look, lady!



   

                   

Don't you point...

those dirty green sausages at me!



   

                   

Your Monte Cristo and coffee.



   

                   

Oh! Sorry.



   

                   

Ah... that's okay.



   

                   

We were just leaving.



   

                   

Very sorry to have wasted your time,

Miss Godmother.



   

                   

Just... go.



   

                   

Come on, guys.



   

                   

[whistles tune]



   

                   

TGIF, eh, buddy?



   

                   

Working hard or hardly working,

eh, Mac?



   

                   

Get your fine Corinthian footwear

and your cat cheeks out of my face!



   

                   

Man, that stinks!



   

                   

You don't exactly smell like

a basket of roses.



   

                   

- Well, one of these has got to help.

- I was just concocting this very plan!



   

                   

Already our minds are becoming one.



   

                   

Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on

licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.



   

                   

Shrek, this is a bad idea.



   

                   

Look. Make yourself useful

and go keep watch.



   

                   

Puss, do you think you

could get to those on top?



   

                   

No problema, boss.

In one of my nine lives,



   

                   

I was the great cat burglar

of Santiago de Compostela.



   

                   

Ha-ha-ha-ha!



   

                   

Shrek, are you off your nut?



   

                   

Donkey, keep watch.



   

                   

Keep watch?

Yeah, I'll keep watch.



   

                   

I'll watch that wicked witch come and

whammy a world of hurt up your backside.



   

                   

I'll laugh, too.

I'll be giggling to myself.



   

                   

- What do you see?

- Toad Stool Softener?



   

                   

I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution

for marital problems.



   

                   

- Elfa Seltzer?

- Uh-uh.



   

                   

- Hex Lax?

- No! Try "handsome."



   

                   

Sorry. No handsome.



   

                   

Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?



   

                   

Well, what does it do?



   

                   

It says "Beauty Divine."



   

                   

In some cultures, donkeys are revered

as the wisest of creatures.



   

                   

Especially us talking ones.



   

                   

[gasps] Donkey!



   

                   

That'll have to do.

We've got company.



   

                   

Can we get on with this?



   

                   

Hurry!



   

                   

Nice catch, Donkey!



   

                   

Finally! A good use for your mouth.

Come on!



   

                   

  You spurn my natural emotions



   

                   

  You make me feel like dirt

and I'm hurt



   

                   

  And if I start a commotion



   

                   

  I run the risk of losing you

I don't care whose fault it is.

Just get this place cleaned up!



   

                   

And somebody bring me something

deep fried and smothered in chocolate!



   

                   

- Mother!

- Charming. Sweetheart.



   

                   

This isn't a good time, pumpkin.

Mama's working.



   

                   

Whoa, what happened here?



   

                   

- The ogre, that's what!

- What? Where is he, Mom?



   

                   

I shall rend his head

from his shoulders!



   

                   

I will smite him where he stands!



   

                   

He will rue the very day he stole

my kingdom from me!



   

                   

Oh, put it away, Junior!

You're still going to be king.



   

                   

We'll just have to come up

with something smarter.



   

                   

Pardon. Um...



   

                   

Everything is accounted for,

Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.



   

                   

What?



   

                   

Oh...



   

                   

I do believe we can make

this work to our advantage.



   

                   

"Happily Ever After Potion.

"Happiness, comfort

and beauty divine."



   

                   

- You both will be fine?

- I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too.



   

                   

Hey, man, this don't feel right.

My donkey senses are tingling all over.



   

                   

Drop that jug o' voodoo

and let's get out of here.



   

                   

It says, "Beauty Divine."

How bad can it be?



   

                   

[sneezes]



   

                   

See, you're allergic to that stuff.

You'll have a reaction.



   

                   

And if you think that I'll be smearing

Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!



   

                   

Boss, just in case there is something

wrong with the potion...



   

                   

allow me to take the first sip.



   

                   

It would be an honor to lay my life

on the line for you.



   

                   

Oh, no, no. I don't think so.



   

                   

If there'll be any animal testing,

I'll do it.



   

                   

That's the best friend's job.

Now give me that bottle.



   

                   

How do you feel?



   

                   

I don't feel any different.

I look any different?



   

                   

You still look like an ass to me.



   

                   

Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.



   

                   

- Well, here's to us, Fiona.

- Shrek?



   

                   

- You drink that, there's no going back.

- I know.



   

                   

- No more wallowing in the mud?

- I know.



   

                   

- No more itchy butt crack?

- I know!



   

                   

- But you love being an ogre!

- I know!



   

                   

But I love Fiona more.

Got to be... I think you grabbed

the "Farty Ever After" potion.



   

                   

Maybe it's a dud.



   

                   

Or maybe Fiona and I

were never meant to be.



   

                   

Or maybe Fiona and I

were never meant to be.

Uh-oh. What did I tell you?

I feel something coming on.



   

                   

I don't want to die.

I don't want to die. I don't want to die!



   

                   

Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.

I'm melting!



   

                   

I'm melting!



   

                   

It's just the rain, Donkey.



   

                   

[chuckles] Oh.



   

                   

Don't worry. Things seem bad

because it's dark and rainy



   

                   

and Fiona's father hired

a sleazy hitman to whack you.

What is it, darling?



   

                   

Dad...



   

                   

I've been thinking

about what you said.



   

                   

And I'm going to set things right.



   

                   

Ah! Excellent!

That's my girl.



   

                   

It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.



   

                   

I'm going to go out and find him.



   

                   

And then we'll go back

to the swamp where we belong.



   

                   

[Lillian] Fiona, please!

You can't go anywhere right now.

Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.

- Here, I fetched a pail of water.



   

                   

Thanks.



   

                   

Uhh!



   

                   

Aahh!

- A stallion, baby!



   

                   

I can whinny.



   

                   

[whinnies]

I can count.



   

                   

Look at me, Shrek!

I'm trotting!



   

                   

That's some quality potion.

What's in that stuff?



   

                   

"Oh, don't take the potion,

Mr. Boss, it's very bad."



   

                   

Pah!

I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place! Yeah!



   

                   

What?

Midnight?

Why is it always midnight?



   

                   

- Pick me! I'll be your true love!

- I'll be your true love.



   

                   

I'll be true... enough.



   

                   

Look, ladies, I already have a true love.



   

                   

[all] Oh...



   

                   

And take it from me, Boss.



   

                   

You are going to have

one satisfied Princess.



   

                   

And let's face it.

You are a lot easier on the eyes.



   

                   

Inside you're the same

old mean, salty...



   

                   

- Easy.

...cantankerous, foul,

And you're still the same

annoying donkey.



   

                   

- Yeah.

- [sighs]



   

                   

Well...



   

                   

Look out, Princess.

Here comes the new me.



   

                   

First things first.



   

                   

- We need to get you out of those clothes.

- [all gasp]



   

                   

- Ready?

- Ready!



   

                   

- [Donkey screams]

- Driver, stop!



   

                   

Oh, God! Help me, please!

My racing days are over!



   

                   

I'm blind! Tell the truth.



   

                   

Will I ever play the violin again?



   

                   

You poor creature!



   

                   

Is there anything

I can do for you?



   

                   

Well, I guess there is one thing.



   

                   

Take off the powdered wig

and step away from your drawers.



   

                   

- Not bad.

- Not bad at all.

Is everything all right, Father?



   

                   

Thank you, gentlemen!

Someday, I will repay you.

I can't find you or if I forget.

Hello, handsome.

Wow! That potion

worked on you, too?



   

                   

What potion?



   

                   

Shrek and I took some magic potion.

And well...



   

                   

Now, we're sexy!

- Yeah, you wish.

- Donkey, where is Shrek?



   

                   

He went inside looking for you.



   

                   

Shrek?

You want to dance, pretty boy?



   

                   

Are you going so soon?

Don't you want to see your wife?



   

                   

Fiona?

Aye, Fiona. It is me.



   

                   

What happened to your voice?



   

                   

The potion changed

a lot of things, Fiona.



   

                   

But not the way I feel about you.



   

                   

Fiona?



   

                   

- Charming?

- Do you think so?



   

                   

[laughs] Dad. I was so hoping

you'd approve.



   

                   

- Um... Who are you?

- Mom, it's me, Shrek.



   

                   

I know you never get a second chance

at a first impression,

Oh, shoot! I don't think they

can hear us, pigeon.



   

                   

[sighs deeply]



   

                   

Don't you think you've already

messed her life up enough?



   

                   

I just wanted her to be happy.



   

                   

And now she can be.



   

                   

Oh, sweetheart.



   

                   

She's finally found

the prince of her dreams.



   

                   

But look at me.

Look what I've done for her.



   

                   

It's time you stop living

in a fairy tale, Shrek.



   

                   

She's a princess,

and you're an ogre.



   

                   

That's something no amount

of potion will ever change.



   

                   

But...



   

                   

I love her.



   

                   

If you really love her...



   

                   

you'll let her go.

with this, would you, Harold?

It was all just a stupid mistake.



    

                   

I never should have rescued her

from that tower in the first place.

What choice do I have?



    

                   

She loves that pretty boy,

Prince Charming.



    

                   

Come on. Is he really

that good-looking?



    

                   

Are you kidding?

He's gorgeous!



    

                   

He has a face that looks like

it was carved by angels.



    

                   

- Oh. He sounds dreamy.

- You know...



    

                   

shockingly, this isn't

making me feel any better.



    

                   

Look, guys.

It's for the best.

she's always dreamed of.

You love Fiona.



    

                   

Aye.



    

                   

And that's why

I have to let her go.



    

                   

Excuse me, is she here?



    

                   

She's, uh... in the back.



    

                   

Oh, hello again.

You'd better have a good reason

for dragging us down here, Harold.



    

                   

Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really...

warming up to Prince Charming.



    

                   

- FYI, not my fault.

- No, of course it's not, dear.



    

                   

I mean,

how charming can I be

I'm that dreadful ogre?



    

                   

No, no, it's nobody's fault.



    

                   

Perhaps it's best if we just

call the whole thing off, okay?



    

                   

- [both] What?

- You can't force someone to fall in love!



    

                   

I beg to differ.

I do it all the time!



    

                   

Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love

with the first man she kisses,



    

                   

which will be Charming.



    

                   

- Umm... no.

- What did you say?



    

                   

I can't. I won't do it.



    

                   

Oh, yes, you will.

He's all high in the front.

into the forest. Requesting backup.

[knock on door]



    

                   

Darling?



    

                   

Ah. I thought I might

find you here.



    

                   

How about a nice hot cup

of tea before the ball?



    

                   

I'm not going.



    

                   

The whole Kingdom's turned out

to celebrate your marriage.



    

                   

There's just one problem.

That's not my husband.



    

                   

I mean, look at him.



    

                   

Yes, he is a bit different,



    

                   

but people change

for the ones they love.



    

                   

You'd be surprised how much

I changed for your mother.



    

                   

Change?



    

                   

He's completely lost his mind!



    

                   

Why not come down to the ball

and give him another chance?



    

                   

You might find you like

this new Shrek.



    

                   

But it's the old one

I fell in love with, Dad.



    

                   

I'd give anything to have him back.



    

                   

Darling. That's mine. Decaf.



    

                   

Otherwise I'm up all night.



    

                   

Thanks.



    

                   

I got to get out of here!



    

                   

I got to get out of here!



    

                   

You can't lock us up like this!

Let me go!



    

                   

What about my Miranda rights?



    

                   

You're supposed to say

I have the right to remain silent.



    

                   

Nobody said I have the right

to remain silent!



    

                   

You have the right to remain silent.



    

                   

What you lack is the capacity.



    

                   

I must hold on before I, too,

go totally mad.



    

                   

Shrek? Donkey?



    

                   

Too late.



    

                   

Gingy! Pinocchio!

Get us out of here!



    

                   

Oh...

- What should I say?

- Anything, but quick!



    

                   

Say something crazy like

"I'm wearing ladies' underwear!"



    

                   

I am wearing ladies' underwear.



    

                   

- Are you?

- I most certainly am not!



    

                   

It looks like you

most certainly am are!



    

                   

- I am not!

- What kind?



    

                   

- It's a thong!

- Oww! They're briefs!



    

                   

- Are not.

- Are too!

Here we go. Hang tight.

Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey!



    

                   

Ow!



    

                   

- Excuse me?

- What? Puss!



    

                   

Pardon me, would you

mind letting me go?



    

                   

- Sorry, boss.

- Quit messing around!



    

                   

We've got to stop that kiss!



    

                   

I thought you was going

to let her go.



    

                   

I was, but I can't let them

do this to Fiona.



    

                   

Boom! That's what I like to hear.

Look who's coming around!



    

                   

It's impossible!

We'll never get in.

creek without a Popsicle stick.



    

                   

- What?

- Do you still know the Muffin Man?



    

                   

Well, sure!

He's down on Drury Lane. Why?



    

                   

Because we're gonna need flour.



    

                   

Lots and lots of flour.

Shrek, what are you doing?



    

                   

I'm just playing the part, Fiona.



    

                   

Is that glitter on your lips?



    

                   

Mm. Cherry flavored.

Want to taste?

Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.



    

                   

Fiona, my Princess.



    

                   

Will you honor me with a dance?



    

                   

  Where have all the good men gone



    

                   

  And where are all the gods?



    

                   

[all chant] Dance!



    

                   

  Where's the streetwise Hercules



    

                   

  To fight the rising odds?



    

                   

Since when do you dance?



    

                   

Fiona, my dearest,

if there's one thing I know,



    

                   

it's that love is full of surprises.



    

                   

  Late at night I toss and I turn



    

                   

  And I dream of what I need



    

                   

Hit it!



    

                   

  I need a hero



    

                   

All right, big fella!

Let's crash this party!

Man the cauldrons!



    

                   

After you, Mongo.



    

                   

- That's it! Heave-ho!

- Watch out!



    

                   

Shrek!



    

                   

More heat, less foam!



    

                   

  Up where the mountains

Meet the heavens above



    

                   

  Out where the lightning

Splits the sea



    

                   

  I could swear there is someone

Somewhere watching me



    

                   

Heave! Ho!



    

                   

[Gingy, slow-motion] No...!

Look out!



    

                   

- Be good.

  He's gotta be strong

And he's gotta be fast



    

                   

  And he's gotta be fresh

From the fight



    

                   

-   I need a hero  

- Stop!

- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.

- Shrek?



    

                   

You couldn't just go back to your swamp

and leave well enough alone.

Kiss her now!



    

                   

No!



    

                   

- Hi-ya!

- Fiona.

- Shrek.



    

                   

Harold! You were supposed

to give her the potion!



    

                   

Well, I guess I gave her

the wrong tea.



    

                   

- [Charming] Mommy!

- Mommy?

- Is he...?

- Yup.



    

                   

[croaking]



    

                   

He croaked.



    

                   

Harold?



    

                   

Dad?



    

                   

I'd hoped you'd never

see me like this.



    

                   

- And he gave you a hard time!

- Donkey!



    

                   

No, no, he's right.

I'm sorry.



    

                   

To both of you.



    

                   

I only wanted what

was best for Fiona.



    

                   

But I can see now...



    

                   

she already has it.



    

                   

Shrek, Fiona...



    

                   

Will you accept

an old frog's apologies...



    

                   

and my blessing?



    

                   

Harold?

I'm sorry, Lillian.



    

                   

I just wish I could be

the man you deserve.



    

                   

You're more that man today

than you ever were...

Fiona. Is this what you want?



    

                   

To be this way forever?



    

                   

- What?

- Because if you kiss me now...



    

                   

we can stay like this.



    

                   

You'd do that?



    

                   

- For me?

- Yes.



    

                   

I want what any princess wants.



    

                   

To live happily ever after...



    

                   

with the ogre I married.



    

                   

Whatever happens,

I must not cry!



    

                   

You cannot make me cry!

Aaah! Ow.



    

                   

Oh, no.

a noble steed to me.



    

                   

[giggles] Now, where were we?



    

                   

Oh. I remember.

to be having a fiesta?

  She's into superstitions



    

                   

  Black cats and voodoo dolls



    

                   

- Sing it, Puss!

-   I feel a premonition



    

                   

  That girl's gonna make me fall



    

                   

Here we go!



    

                   

  She's into new sensations



    

                   

  New kicks in the candlelight



    

                   

  She's got a new addiction



    

                   

  For every day and night



    

                   

  She'll make you take your clothes off



    

                   

  And go dancing in the rain



    

                   

  She'll make you live her crazy life



    

                   

  But she'll take away your pain



    

                   

  Like a bullet to your brain



    

                   

  Upside inside out

  All by myself



    

                   

  Don't wanna be



    

                   

  All by myself anymore...

Come on, join us.



    

                   

Thanks, compadre.

I'm... I'm not in the mood.



    

                   

We will cheer you up!

Find you a nice burro!



    

                   

[shrieking]



    

                   

Hey, baby!



    

                   

Hey, that's my girl!

Yeah! All right!



    

                   

Baby, where you been?



    

                   

- [cries]

- I'm sorry, too.



    

                   

I should've stayed.

But Shrek had this thing he had to do.



    

                   

What? Say it one more time.



    

                   

What you talking about?

Are you serious?



    

                   

- [cooing]

- [gasping]

Look at our little mutant babies!



    

                   

[Donkey] I got to get a job.



    

                   

[Donkey] I got to get a job.

Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.

But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only 

be broken by love's first kiss.

She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing 

dragon.

Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, 

but non prevailed.

She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest 

tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.

{Laughing} 

Like that's ever gonna happen.

{Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes}

What a load of - 



Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'

Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'

Didn't make sense not to live for fun

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see

So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets

You'll never know if you don't go

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now You're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

You're bundled up now but wait till you get older

But the meteor men beg to differ

Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin

The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

My world's on fire

How 'bout yours

That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all-star

{Shouting}

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

{Belches}

Go!

Go!

{Record Scratching}

Go. Go.Go.

Hey, now, you're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold



-Think it's in there?

-All right. Let's get it!

-Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

-Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.

{Laughs}

-Yes, well, actually, that would be a gaint.

Now, ogres - - They're much worse.

They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.

-No!

-They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!

Actually, it's quite good on toast.

-Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

{Gasping}

-Right.

{Roaring}

{Shouting}

{Roaring}

{Whispers} This is the part where you run away.

{Gasping}

{Laughs}

{Laughing} And stay out!

"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."

{Sighs}

{Man's voice} All right. This one's full.

-Take it away!

{Gasps}

-Move it along. Come on! Get up!

-Next!

-Give me that! Your fiying days are over.

That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!

-Get up! Come on!

-Twenty pieces.

{Thudding}

-Sit down there!

-Keep quiet!

{Crying}

-This cage is too small.

-Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again.

I can change. Please! Give me another chance!

-Oh, shut up.

-Oh!

-Next!

-What have you got?

-This little wooden puppet.

-I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.

-Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.

-Father, please! Don't let them do this!

-Help me!

-Next! What have you got?

-Well, I've got a talking donkey.

{Grunts}

-Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.

-Oh, go ahead, little fella.

-Well?

-Oh, oh, he's just - - He's just a little nervous.

He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt - -

-That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

-No, no, he talks! He does. I can talk. I love to talk.

I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.

-Get her out of my sight.

-No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

{Gasps}

-Hey! I can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can talk!

-Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly

but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha!

Oh-oh.

{Grunts}

-Seize him!

-After him! He's getting away!

{Grunts, Gasps}

{Man}

-Get him! This way! Turn!

-You there. Orge!

-Aye?

-By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under 

arrest

and transport you to a designated..... resettlement facility.

-Oh, really? You and what army?

{Gasps, Whimpering}

{Chuckles}

-Can I say something to you?

-Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. 

Incredible!

Are you talkin' to - - me? Whoa!

-Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great 

back here? Those guards!

They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They 

was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made 

me feel good to see that.

-Oh, that's great. Really.

-Man, it's good to be free.

-Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? 

Hmm?

-But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by 

myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. 

You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit 

out of anybody that crosses us.

{Roaring}

-Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that 

don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you 

definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks!

You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - 

{Mumbling}

Than I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my 

butt that day.

-Why are you following me?

-I'll tell you why. 



'Cause I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

My promlems have all gone

There's no one to deride me

But you gotta heve friends - - 



-Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.

-Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.

-Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?

-Uh - - Really tall?

-No! I'm an orge! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't 

that bother you?

-Nope.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Oh.

-Man, I like you. What's you name?

-Uh, Shrek.

-Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek?

You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.

I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that. 

Who'd want to live in place like that?

-That would be my home.

-Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a 

decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I 

like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.

-I guess you don't entertain much, do you?

-I like my privacy.

-You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I 

hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them 

a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence.

-Can I stay with you?

-Uh, what?

-Can I stay with you, please?

-Of course!

-Really?

-No.

-Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to 

be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta 

stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!

-Okay! Okay! But one night only.

-Ah! Thank you!

-What are you - - No! No!

-This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, 

and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.

-Oh!

-Where do, uh, I sleep?

-Outside!

-Oh, well. I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you 

don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know.

{Sniffles}

-Here I go.

-Good night.

{Sighs}

-I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. 

I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, 

outside.



I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

{Bubbling}

{Sighs}

{Creaking}

{Sighs}

-I thought I told you to stay outside.

-I'm outside.

{Clattering}

-Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we 

have? 

-It's not home, but it'll do just fune.

-What a lovely bed.

-Got ya.

{Sniffs} I found some cheese.

-Ow! {Grunts}

-Blah! Awful stuff.

-Is that you, Gorder?

-How did you know?

-Enough! What are you doing in my house?

{Grunts}

-Hey!

{Snickers}

-Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.

-Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.

-Huh?

{Gusps}

{Male voice} What?

-I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying orge! What do I 

have to do get a little privacy?

-Aah!

-Oh, no. No! No!

{Cackling}

-What?

-Quit it.

-Don't push.

{Squeaking}

{Lows}

- What are you doing in my swamp?

{Echoing}

Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!

{Gasping}

-Oh, dear!

-Whoa!

-All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! 

Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey!

-Quickly. Come on!

-No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there.

-Oh!

{Sighs}

-Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

-Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

-What?

-We were forced to come here.

-By who?

-Lord Farquaad.

-He huffed und he puffed und he...... signed an eviction notice.

{Sighs}

-All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?

{Murmuring}

-Oh, I do. I know where he is.

-Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?

-Me! Me!

-Anyone?

-Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!

{Sighs}

-Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. 

Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy 

Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came 

from!

{Cheering}

{Twittering}

-Oh! You! You're comin' with me.

- All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two 

stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!

-On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek.

-Hey. Oh, oh!

-I can't wait to get on the road again.

-What did I say about singing?

-Can I whistle?

-No.

-Can I hum it?

-All right, hum it.

{Humming}



{Grunts}

{Whimpering}

-That's enough. He's ready to talk.

{Coughing}

{Laughing}

{Clears throat}

-Run, run, run, as fust as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the 

gingerbread man!

-You are a monster.

-I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy 

tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the 

others?

-Eat me!{Grunts}

-I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached 

its end! Tell me or I'll - -

-No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons.

-All right then. Who's hiding them?

-Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?

-The muffin man?

-The muffin man.

-Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?

-Well, she's married to the muffin man.

-The muffin man?

-The muffin man!

-She's married to the muffin man.

{Door opens}

-My lord! We found it.

-Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in.

{Man grunting}

{Gasping}

-Oh!

-Magic mirror - - 

-Don't tell him anything!

-No!

{Ginerbread man whispers}

-Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect 

kingdom of them all?

-Well, technically you're not a king.

-Uh, Thelonius.

-You were saying?

-What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one.  All 

you have to do is marry a princess.

-Go on.

{Chuckles}

-So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to 

meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette 

number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. 

She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking 

and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.

-Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of 

fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just 

kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come 

on. Give it up for Snow White!

-And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a 

fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling 

lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes 

pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, 

Princess Fiona!

-So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or 

bachelorette number three?

-Two! Two!

-Three! Three!

-Two! Two!

-Three! 

-Three? One?

{Shudders} Three?

--Three! Pick number three, my lord!

-Okay, okay, uh, number three!

-Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.



If you like pina coladas

And getting caught in the rain



-Princess Fiona.



If you're not into yoga



-She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go - - 

-But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.

-I'll do it.

-Yes, but after sunset - -

-Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will 

finally have the perfect king!

Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament.



-But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd 

find it.

-So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.

-Uh-huh. That's the place.

-Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?

{Laughs}

{Groans}

-Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

-Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.

-Hey, you!

{Screams}

-Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - -

{Whimpering}

{Sighs}

{Whimpering, Groans}

{Turnstile clatters}

{Chuckles}

{Sighs}

-It's quiet. Too quiet.

{Creaking}

-Where is everybody?

-Hey, look at this!

{Clattering, whirring, clicking}

Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town

Here we have some rules

Let us lay them down

Don't make waves, stay in line

And we'll get along fine

DuLoc is perfect place

Please keep off of the grass

Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

DuLoc is, DuLoc is

DuLoc is perfect ...... place

{Camera shutter clicks

{Whirring}

-Wow! Let's do that again!

-No. No. No, no, no! No.

{Trumpet fanfare}

{Crowd cheering}

-Brave knights.

-You are the best and brightest in all the land.

-Today one of you shall prove himself - -

-All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.

-Sorry about that.

{Cheering}

-That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go 

forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the 

dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first 

runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you mae 

die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.

{Cheering}

-Let the tournament begin!

{Gasps}

-Oh!

-What is that?

{Gasping}

-It's hideous!

-Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey.

-Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the orge will be named 

champion! Have it him!

-Get him!

-Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now.

-Go ahead! Get him!

-Can't we just settle this over a pint?

-Kill the beast!

-No? All right then. Come on!



I don't give a damn about my reputation

You're living in the past 

It's a new generation



-Damn!

{Whinnying}



A girl can do what she wants to do

And that's what I'm gonna do

And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me

Me, me, me



-Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!



And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Never said I wanted to improve my station



-Ah!

{Laughs}



And I'm always feelin' good when I'm having fun



-Yeah!



And I don't have to please no one



-The chair! Give him the chair!



And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me

Me, me, me

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me, not me

{Bell dings}

{Cheering}

{Laughs}

-Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till 

Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha!

{Shrek laughs}

{Crowd gasping, murmuring}

-Shall I give the order, sir?

-No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!

-What?

-Congratulations, orge. You're won the honor of embarking on a great 

and noble quest.

-Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back.

-Your swamp?

-Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those tale creatures!

{Crowd murmuring}

-Indeed. All right, orge. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for 

me, and I'll give you your swamp back.

-Exactly the way it was?

-Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.

-And the squatters?

-As good as gone.

-What kind of quest?

-Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a 

princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only 

don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place.

-Is that about right?

-Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

-I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on 

him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make 

your bread, the whole orge trip.

-Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and 

put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and 

drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?

-Uh, no, not really, no.

-For your information, there's a lot more to orges than people think.

-Example?

-Example? Okay, um, orges are like onions.

-{Sniffs} They stink?

-Yes - - No!

-They make you cry?

-No!

-You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little 

white hairs.

-No! Layers! Onions have layers. Orges have layers! Onions have 

layers. You get it? We both have layers. 

{Sighs}

-Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes 

onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.

-I don't care... what everyone likes. Orges are not like cakes.

-You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a 

person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "No, I don't like 

no parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.

-No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Orges are like 

onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.

-Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.

-You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissure or 

something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start 

slobbering.



I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

And everything that you receive up yonder

Is what you give to me the day I wander

I'm on my way 

I'm on my way 

I'm on my way 



-Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?

-You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was 

open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. {Sniffs} It's 

brimstone We must be getting close.

-Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I 

know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone 

neither.

{Rumbling}

-Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location.

{Laughing}

-Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said orges have layers?

-Oh, aye.

-Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have 

layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.

-Wait a second.  Donkeys don't have sleeves.

-You know what I mean.

-You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

-I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over 

a boiling like of lava!

-Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional 

support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step 

at a time.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Okay, that makes me feel so much better.

-Just keep moving. And don't look  down.

-Okay, don't look  down. Don't look  down. Don't look  down. Keep on 

moving. Don't look  down.

{Gasps}

-Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, 

please! 

-But you're already halfway.

-But I know that half is safe!

-Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

-Shrek, no! Wait!

-Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me?

-Don't do that!

-Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

-Oh, this?

-Yes, that!

-Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

{Screams}

-No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

-You said do it! I'm doin' it.

-I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh!

-That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.

-Cool.

-So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

-Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

{Chuckles}

-I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

{Water dripping, wind howling}

-You afraid?

-No.

-But - -

- Shh.

-Oh, good. Me neither.

{Gasps}

-'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 

response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I 

might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and 

breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little 

scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.

{Gasps}

-Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if 

you can find any stairs.

-Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.

-The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest 

tower.

-What makes you think she'll be there?

-I read it in a book once.

-Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those 

stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way 

they're goin'.

{Creacing}

-I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with 

me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a 

step right here. I'd step all over it.

-Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - 

-Dragon!

{Screams}

{Gasps}

{Roars}

-Donkey, look out!

{Screams}

{Whimpering}

-Got ya!

{Roars}

{Gasps}

{Shouts}

-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

{Screaming}

{Gasps}

-Oh! Aah! Aah!

{Gasping}

{Crowls}

-No. Oh, no, No!

{Screams}

-Oh, what large teeth you have.

{Crowls}

-I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time 

from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile 

you got  there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know 

what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of 

course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. 

What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. 

Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh - - 

(Coughs)

-I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna 

blow smoke rings. Shrek!

{Gasps}

{Whimpering}

-No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

{Groans, Sighs}

{Vocalizing}

-Oh! Oh!

-Wake up!

-What?

-Are you Princess Fiona?

-I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

-Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

-But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be 

a wonderful, romantic moment?

-Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.

-Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out 

yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

-You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

-Mm-hmm.

{Screams, grunts}

-But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for 

me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!

-I don't think so.

-Can I at least know the name of my champion?

-Um, Shrek.

-Sir Shrek.

{Cleans throat}

-I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.

-Thanks!

{Roaring}

-You didn't slay the dragon?

-It's on my to-do list. Now come on!

{Screams}

-But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, 

banner flying. That's what all the other knights did.

-Yeah, right before they burst into flame.

-That's not the point. Oh!

-Wait. Where are you going? The next's over there.

-Well, I have to save my ass.

-What kind of knight are you?

-One of a kind.

-Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to 

know someone over a long perriod of time. Just call me old-fashioned. 

{Laughs}

-I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not 

emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - -  Magnitude really 

is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted 

physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back 

up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to 

know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, 

but I just love receiving cards - -  I'd really love to stay, but - - 

Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna 

tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with 

that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!

{Growls}

{Roaring}

{Gasps}

-Hi, Princess!

-It talks!

-Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

{Screams}

{Screaming}

-Oh!

{Thuds}

{Groans}

{Roars}

{Roaring}

-Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon.

{Fchoing}

-Run!

{Gasping}

{Screaming}

{Roaring}

{Screams}

{Roars}

{Panting, sighs}

{Whimpers}

{Roars}

-You did it!

-You rescued me! You're amazing. You're - - You're wonderful. 

You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But they deed is great, and 

thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. 

{Clears throat}

-And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?

-I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a 

steed.

-The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.

-Uh, no.

-Why not?

-I have helmet hair.

-Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.

-No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

-But how will you kiss me?

-What? That wasn't in the job description.

-Maybe it's a perk.

-No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in 

a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then 

they share true love's first kiss.

-Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you 

true love?

-Well, yes.

{Laughing}

-You think Shrek is your true love!

-What is so funny?

-Let's just say I'm not your tipe, okay?

-Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your 

helmet.

-Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

-Just take off the helmet.

-I'm not going to.

-Take ot off.

-No!

-Now!

-Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.

-You- - You're a- - an orge.

-Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

-Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed 

to be an orge.

{Sighs}

-Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the 

one who wants to marry you.

-Then why didn't he come rescue me?

-Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.

-But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some prge and his- - 

his pet.

-So much for noble steed.

-You're not making my job any easier.

-I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad 

that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right 

here.

-Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.

-You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

-Ya comin', Donkey?

-I'm right behind ya.

-Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not 

dignified! Put me down!

-Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, 

right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down 

real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a 

crisp and eaten?

-You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knowest what 

happens when you find your - -  Hey!

{Sighs}

-The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.

-You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!

-And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

-Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in 

short supply.

{Laughs}

-I don't know. There are those who think little of him.

-Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never 

measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

-Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the 

"measuring" when you see him tomorrow.

-Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?

-No, that'll take longer. We can keep going.

-But there's robbers in the woods.

-Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good.

-Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this 

forest.

-I need to find somewhere to camp now!

{Birds wings fluttering}

{Grunting}

-Hey! Over here.

-Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a 

princess.

-No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

-Homey touches? Like what?

{Crashing}

-A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

-You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.

-I said good night!

-Shrek, What are you doing?

{Laughs}

-I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.

{Fire cracking}

-And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only orge to ever spit over 

three wheat fields. Right. Yeah.

-Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?

-The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, 

there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.

-I know you're making this up.

-No, look. There he is,  and there's the group of hunters running away 

from his stench.

-That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.

-You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? 

Forget it.

{Sighs}

-Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?

-Our swamp?

-You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.

-We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's no "our". There's just me and my 

swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my 

land.

-You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what 

I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody 

out.

-No, do ya think?

-Are you hidin' something?

-Never mind, Donkey.

-Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

-No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things.

-Why don't you want to talk about it?

-Why do you want to talk about it?

-Why are you blocking?

-I'm not blocking.

-Oh, yes, you are.

-Donkey, I'm warning you.

-Who you trying to keep out?

-Everyone! Okay?

-Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.

-Oh! For the love of Pete!

-What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?

-Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that 

seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. 

"Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly orge!" They judge me before they 

even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.

-You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, 

stupid, ugly orge.

-Yeah, I know.

-So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

-Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying.

-Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one 

there?

-That's the moon.

-Oh, okay.



{Orchestra}

{Dulcimer}

-Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the 

princess.

-Hmph.

-Ah. Perfect.

{Inhales}



{Snoring}

{Vocalizing}

{Whistling}

{Sizzling}

{Sniffs, yawns}

-Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that.

--Come on, baby. I said I like it.

-Donkey, wake up.

-Huh? What?

-Wake up.

-What?

-Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs?

-Good morning, Princess!

-What's all this about?

-You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to 

make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

-Uh, thanks.

{Sniffs}

-Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

{Belches}

-Shrek!

-What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. {Laughs}

-Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess.

{Belches}

-Thanks.

-She's as nasty as you are.

-{Laughs} You know, you're not exactly what I expected.

-Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.

{Vocalizing}



-La liberte! Hey!

-Princess!

{Laughs}

-What are you doing?

-Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from 

this green - -

{Kissing sounds}

-beast.

-Hey!

-That's my princess! Go find you own!

-Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

-Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!

-Oh! Of couse! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduse myself. Oh, Merry 

Men. 

{Laughs}

Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

I steal from the rich and give to the needy.

But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels

Man, I'm good

What a guy, Monsieur Hood

Break it down

I like an honest fight

and a saucy little maid

What he's basically saying

is he likes to get - - 

Paid

So

When an orge in the bush

grabs a lady by the tush

That's bad

That's bad

When a beauty's with a beast

it makes me awfully mad

He's mad

He's really, really mad

I'll take my blade and

Keep your eyes on me, boys

'cause I'm about to start



{Grunts, Groans}

{Karate Yell}

{Merry Men Gasping}

{Panting}

-Man, that was annoying!

-Oh, you little- - 

{Karate Yell}

{Accordion}

{Shouting, groaning}

{Chuckles}

-Uh, shall we?

-Hold the phone.

{Grunts}

Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?

-What?

-That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?

-Well - - {Chuckles} When one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these 

things in case there's a - - There's an arrow in your butt!

-What? Oh, would you look at that?

-Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

-Why? What's wrong?

-Shrek's hurt.

-Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.

-Donkey, I'm okay.

-You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep 

you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the 

Heimlich?

-Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and 

find me a blue flower with red thorns.

-Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. 

Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

-{Both} Donkey!

-Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

-What are the flowers for?

-For getting rid of Donkey.

-Ah.

-Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out.

-Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.

-I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

-No, it's tender.

-Now, hold on.

-What you're doing is the opposite of help.

-Don't move.

-Look, time out.

-Would you - - 

{Grunts}

-Okay. What do you propose we do?

-Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red 

thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue 

flower, red thorns.

-Ow!

-Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!

-Ow! Not good.

-Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head.

{Grunts}

-It's just about - - 

-Ow! Ohh!

-Ahem.

-Nothing happend. We were just, uh - - 

-Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay?

-Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was 

just- - Ugh! 

-Ow!

-Hey, what's that?

{Nervous chickle}

-That's- - Is that blood?

{Sighs}

{Bird chirping}

{Grunts}



My beloved monster and me

We go everywhere together

Wearin' a raincoat

that has four sleeves

Gets us through all kinds of weather



-Aah!



She will always be the only thing

That comes between me and the awful sting

That comes from living in a world

that's so damn mean

{Croaks}

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

-Hey!

La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la

{Both laughing}

La-la, la-la, la-la



-There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you.

-That's DuLoc?

-Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for 

something,  which I think means he has a really - - Ow!

-Um, I, uh- -  I guess we better move on.

-Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried about Donkey.

{Blubbering}

-What?

-I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good. 

-What are you talking about? I'm fine.

-That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on 

your back. Dead.

-You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?

-Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.

-I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and 

when I turn my head like this, look, 

{Bones crunch}

-Ow! See?

-Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.

-I'll get the firewood.

-Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! I don't have any 

toes! I think I need a hug.



-Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?

-Uh, weedrat. Rotisserie style.

-No kidding. Well, this is delicious.

-Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I 

make a mean weedrat stew.

{Chuckling}

{Sighs}

-I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.

{Gulps}

-Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind 

of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it.

{Chuckles}

-I'd like that.

{Slurps, laughs}



See the pyramids along the Nile



-Um, Princess?



Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle



-Yes, Shrek?

-I, um, I was wondering.



Just remember, darling all the while



-Are you- - 



You belong to me



{Sighs} 

-Are you gonna eat that?

{Chuckles}

-Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.

-Sunset?

-Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late.

-What?

-Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, 

aren't you?

-Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside.

-Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until 

- - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

{Shrek sighs}

 -Good night.

 -Good night.

{Door creaks}

-Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.

-Oh, what are you talkin' about?

-I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. 

And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

-You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

-Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in 

and tell her how you feel.

-I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, 

well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a 

princess, and I'm - - 

-An orge?

-Yeah. An orge.

-Hey, where you goin'?

-To get... move firewood.

{Sighs} 



-Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you?

{Wings fluttering}

-Princess?

{Creaking}

{Gasps}

-It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.

{Screams}

-Aah!

-Oh, no!

-No, help!

-Shh!

-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

-No, it's okay. It's okay.

-What did you do with the princess?

-Donkey, I'm the princess.

-Aah!

-It's me, in this body.

-Oh, my God! You ate the princess. Can you hear me?

-Donkey!

-Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!

-No!

-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

-Shh.

-Shrek!

-This is me.

{Muffled mumbling}

-Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.

-I'm ugly, okay?

-Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats 

was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - - 

-No.

-I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember.

-What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.

-It's only happens when sun goes down.

"By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you 

find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."

-Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.

-It's a spell.

{Sighs} 

-When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I 

become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to 

await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry 

Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.

{Sobs}

-All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not 

that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look 

like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.

-But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant 

to look.

-Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?

-I have to.  Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.

-But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you 

got a lot in common.

-Shrek?



-Princess, I - - Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for 

me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's 

pretty and - - well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might 

like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd - - uh, uh - 

- 

{Sighs}

-I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

-I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I 

mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? 

"Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here 

with Shrek.

{Gasps}

-My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

{Deep sigh}

-Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only 

way to break the spell.

-You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

-No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.

-What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?

-Promise you won't tell. Promise!

-All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. I just know 

before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy.

-Look at my eye twitchin'.

{Door opens}

{Snoring}

-I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. 

-Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want - - 

{Snoring}

-Shrek. Are you all right?

-Perfect! Never been better.

-I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you.

-You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last 

night.

-You heard what I said?

-Every word.

-I thought you'd understand.

-Oh, I undersatnd. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly 

beast?" 

-But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

-Yeah? Well, it does.

{Gasps, sighs}

-Ah, right on time.

{Horse whinnies}

-Princess, I've brought you a little something.

{Fanfare}

{Yawns}

-What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

{Muffled}

-Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.

-Princess Fiona.

-As promised. Now hand it over.

-Very well, orge. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

-Take it and go before I change my mind.

-Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I 

have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I'm Lord Farquaad.

-Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.

{Snaps fingers}

-Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... farewell.

-Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the 

orge. It's not like it has feelings.

-No, you're right. It doesn't.

-Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawerss Fiona. I ask your hand in 

marriage.

{Gasps}

-Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

-Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make - - 

-Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!

-No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun 

sets.

-Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's 

so much to do! Threre's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest 

list. Captain, round up some guests!

-Fare-thee-well, orge.

-Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.

-Yeah? So what?

-Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to 

her last night, She's - - 

-I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? 

Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?

-Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.

-I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! 

My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, 

pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

-But I thought - - 

-Yeah. You know what? You tought wrong!

-Shrek.



I heard there was a secret chord

That David played and it pleased the Lord

But you don't really care for music, do ya

It goes like this the fourth, the fifth

The minor fall the major lift

The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah,  hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before

I know this room I've walked this floor

I used to live alone before I knew you

I've seen your flag on the marble arch

But love is not a victory march

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah,  hallelujah

And all I ever learned from love

Is how to shoot at someone

Who outdrew you

{Moaning}

And it's not a cry you can hear at night

It's not somebody who's seen the light

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

{Moaning}

Hallelujah,  hallelujah



{Thumping sound}

-Donkey?

{Grunts}

-What are you doing?

-I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see 

one.

-Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not 

through it.

-It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.

-Oh! Your half. Hmm.

-Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I 

get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks 

like your head.

-Back off!

-No, you back off.

-This is my swamp!

-Our swamp.

-Let go, Donkey!

-You let go.

-Stubborn jackass!

-Smelly orge.

-Fine!

-Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.

-Well, I'm through with you.

-Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess 

what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are 

mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! 

You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

-Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

-Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!

-Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in 

the back!

-Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your 

own feelings.

-Go away!

-There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she 

ever do was like you, maybe even love you.

-Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of 

you talking. 

-She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody 

else.

-She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?

-Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. 

Right? Right?

-Donkey!

-No!

-Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?

{Sighs}

-I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge. Can you 

forgive me?

-Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

-Right. Friends?

-Friends.

-So, um, what did Fiona say about me?

-What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?

-The wedding! We'll never make it in time.

-Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I 

have a way.

{Whistles}

-Donkey?

-I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

{Laughing}

-Aw, come here, you.

-All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. 

All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install 

the seat belts yet.

-Whoo!

{Bells tolling}

{All gasping}

-People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the union....

-Um-

-of our new king - -

-Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

{Chuckling}

-Go on.

-Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about 

that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't 

you?

-What are you talking about?

-There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak 

now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!"

-I don't have time for this!

-Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this 

woman, don't you?

-Yes.

-You wanna hold her?

-Yes.

-Please her?

-Yes!

-Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. The chicks love that 

romantic crap!

-All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?

-We gotta check it out.



-And so, by the power vested in me, 

-What do you see?

-The whole town's in there.

-I now pronounce you husband and wife,

-They're at the altar.

-king and queen.

-Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

-Oh, for the love of Pete!

{Grunts}

-I object!

-Shrek?

{Gasps}

-Oh, now what does he want?

-Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first at all. 

Very clean.

-What are you doing here?

-Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but 

showing up uninvited to a wedding - -

-Fiona! I need to talk to you.

-Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll 

excuse me - - 

-But you can't marry him.

-And why not?

-Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king.

-Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

-He's not your true love.

-And what do you know about true love?

-Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - - 

-Oh, this is precious. The orge has fallen in love with the princess! 

Oh, good Lord.

{Crowd laughting}

-An orge and a princess!

-Shrek, is this true?

-Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away 

from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! Mmmmm!

-"By night one way, by day another." I wanted to show you before.

{Whimpers}

{Crown gasping}

-Well, uh, that explains a lot.

-Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of 

my sight now! Get them! Get them both!

-No, no!

-Shrek!

-This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that 

makes me king! See? See?

-No, let go of me! Shrek!

-No!

-Don't just stand there, you morons.

-Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh! 

-I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and 

quartered!

-You'll beg for death to save you!

-No, Shrek!

-And as for you, my wife,

-Fiona!

-I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!

-I'm king!

{Whistles}

-I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have - - Aaaah!

-Aah!

-All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to 

use it.

{Roars}

-I'm a donkey on the edge!

{Belches}

-Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

{Cheering}

-Go ahead, Shrek.

-Uh, Fiona?

-Yes, Shrek?

-I - - I love you.

-Really?

-Really, really.

- I love you too.

-Aawww!

-"Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true 

form."

-"Take love's true form. Take love's true form."

-Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?

-Well, yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.

-But you ARE beautiful.

{Chuckles}

-I was hoping this would be a happy ending.



I thought love was only true in fairy tales

Oy!

Meant for someone else but not for me

Love was out to get me

That's the way it seemed

Disappointment haunted all my dreams

And then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer and not a trace

Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love

Ooh-aah

I'm a believer I couldn't leave her

If I tried



-God bless us, every one.



Come on, y'all!

Then I saw her face

Ha-ha

Now I'm a believer 

Listen!

Not a trace

Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love

Ooh-aah

I'm a believer 

I couldn't leave her if I tried

-Ooh!

-Uh!

Then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer 

Hey!

Not a trace

Uhh! Yeah.

Of doubt in my mind



-One more time!

I'm in love

I'm a believer 

Come on!

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, 

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, hey

Y'all sing it with me!

I

People in the back!

I believe

I'm a believer 

I believe

I believe

I believe

I believe

{Hysterical laughing}

-Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh.

-I can't breathe. I can't breathe. 



I believe in self-assertion

Destiny or a slight diversion

Now it seems I've got my head on straight

I'm a freak an apparition

Seems I've made the right decision

To try to turn back now it might be too late



Now I want to stay home today

Don't wanna go out

If anyone comes to play

Gonna get thrown out

I wanna stay home today

Don't want no company

No way

Yeah, yeah, yeah



I wanna be a millionaire someday

But know what it feels like to give it away

Watch me march to the beat of my own drum

And it's off to the moon and then back again

Same old day Same situation

My happiness rears back as if to say



I wanna stay home today

Don't wanna go out

If anyone comes to play

Gonna get thrown out

I wanna stay home today

Don't want no company

No way

Yeah, yeah, yeah



I wanna stay home, stay home, stay home.........





I get such a thrill when you look in my eyes

My heart skips a beat

Girl, I feel so alive

Please tell me, baby, if all this is true

'Cause deep down inside all I wanted was you

Oh-oh-oh

Makes me wanna dance

Oh-oh-oh

It's a new romance

Oh-oh-oh

I look into your eyes

Oh-oh-oh

The best years of our lives

When we first met

I could hardly believe

The things that would happen 

and we could achieve

So let's be together

for all of our time

Oh, girl, I'm so thankful

that you are still mine

You always consider me

like an ugly duckling

And treat me like a Nostradamus

was why I had to get my shine on

I break a little something

to keep my mind on

'Cause you had my mind gone

Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh

Turn the lights on, Come on, baby

Let's just rewind the song

'Cause all I want to do is 

make the rest years the best years

All night long



Oh-oh-oh

Makes me wanna dance

Makes me wanna dance

Oh-oh-oh

It's a new romance

It's a new romance

Oh-oh-oh

I look into your eyes

Oh, yeah, yeah

I look into your eyes

Oh-oh-oh

The best years of our lives

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..............





Everything looks bright

Standing in your light

Everything feels right

What's left is out of sight

What's a girl to do 

I'm telling you

You're on my mind

I wanna be with you

'Cause when you're

standin' next to me

It's like wow

And all your kisses

seem to set me free

It's like wow

And when we touch

it's such a rush

I can't get enough

It's like- - It's like

Ooh-ooh

Hey, what

It's like wow

Ooh-ooh, hey

Hey, yeah

It's like wow

Everything is looking

right now, right now

It's like wow

And I got this feeling

This feeling 

it's just like wow

It's just like wow

You are all I'm thinking of.

Like wow

Everything feels right

Everything feels right

Like wow

Everything looks bright

All my senses are right

Like wow

Everything feels right

Baby, baby, baby

the way I'm feeling you

Is like wow



There is something

that I see

In the way 

you look at me

There's a smile

There's a truth

In your eyes

What an unexpected way

On this unexpected day

Could it be

This is where I belong

It is you I have loved

All long

There's no more mystery

It is finally clear to me

You're the home

my heart's searched for

So long

It is you I have loved

All long

Whoa, over and over

I'm filled with emotion

As I look

Into your perfect face
